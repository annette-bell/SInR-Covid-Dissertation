# SI<sub>n</sub>R Covid Dissertation

### About:
The Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) compartmental model is used in epidemiology to identify and categorize members of a population based on their status with regards to a disease. Less studied variations of this problem are the SI<sub>n</sub>R and SI<sub>n</sub>RS models. These models, which have applications in latent infection and varying transmission rates, will be used on three different generation interval—the time between primary exposure and secondary infection—distributions: gamma, lognormal, and Weibull. The distributions are ultimately tested against one another to see not only which provides most realistic data, but how these data-sets interact.
